# SwipeWeb
 Trying to implement swipe actions on web
---
This is a little messy, but I think I've done what little I set out to do.
I can tap the message blocks to cycle through a set of colours,
I can swipe to set the colour based on the distance I swipe,
and if I swipe over half the width of the element then it is removed from the document.

I think I'm in a position where I can add this to other projects, and refine my methodology.

Updated to improve the interaction and colours. Now it changes to a random colour on touch,
yellow if it is moved but remains in the centre,
red if it is to the right and will activate the right action (delete in this case),
and blue if it is to the left and will activate the left action (also delete).
